The title may sound stupid, as we obviously use our words (language) to communicate with each other. But there is a fuzziness around the meaning of words we work with and depending on the type of the word (whether it stands for a concrete physical object, or an abstract concept/human emotion), the fuzziness varies greatly. Even when it refers to concrete physical objects, if we look closely enough, the fuzziness can emerge or enlarge. The fact that two humans can communicate and agree closely on the meaning of something while this fuzziness exists is a great achievement in itself, let alone thinking about human society in general.

We live in the age of AI models now. The language models stand on Ludwig Wittgenstein's famous statement, "The meaning of a word is its use in the language". In my view, this only puts the focus on the fuzziness I am talking about.

While the meaning remains fuzzy, the actual outcome or the consequent action of the people are not. In the morning, my wife asked me to give our daughter a bath while she prepares breakfast. The fact the I gave our daughter a bath is an outcome we both agree on. My wife would have been furious if I simply didn't do what she asked me to do. Or I better have an explanation otherwise. A language emerges when the outcome of communication is reasonably acceptable in a society. Humans simply learn how to work with the fuzziness of meaning and form a functioning society.

Science has been successful because it has a clear process by which the outcome of events can be agreed by humans. It uses logic and mathematics to formalize its notions, but any theory or concept is always judged by the outcome that can be measured and agreed with regardless of who you are.

I work on semantic technologies where the objective is to represent information/knowledge in a machine accessible way. The word 'semantic' refers to the meaning of things. And it is my belief that only the outcome of usage of such systems will be able to validate them. For instance, one of the projects I am taking up is the development of an ontology for the Constitution of India and the system of governance (legislature, executive and judiciary) here. While a nice looking ontology for this is good, the way to measure its appropriateness is when we can accurately answer:

1. What are the government schemes applicable for a woman in the State of Tamil Nadu?
2. How to apply for such a scheme? (whom to approach and what information is necessary)
3. Who is responsible for the potholes in the road I am walking right now?
4. Given the complete description and evidence from a murder case, what is the logically deducible outcome as per the Constitution of India and Indian laws?

If I can develop this ontology and subsequently build a knowledge graph of current Indian system, it can become a success only if it is useful in practice.
